# DigiKey-Potentially-Genius-TapTrack
This repository contains all of the files for TapTrack, our package impact tracker. This project is from Episode 21 of Potentially Genius, a YouTube series by DigiKey. The device utilizes the Analog Devices ADXL380 accelerometer. It uses an Adafruit Feather M4 to communicate with the accelerometer over SPI, detect a triple-tap to start tracking, and read out package impact data on an e-ink display. You can find the video link here: [video link]

# Code
The code is in the TapTrack directory.

# 3D Files
